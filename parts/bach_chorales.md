Bach chorales
===

Bach's chorale harmonizations are a reference for everyone studying classical harmony in relation to voice-leading. Harmonizing a chorale melody is a part of [UK college final exams](https://www.rhinegold.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/MT10_scheme_KS5_Bach_chorale_harmonisation.pdf).

- [Chris Gill. Harmonising Bach Chorales](https://amzn.to/3rDe1GH) - A short book describing all aspects of pretty regular bach language (at least those 320 chorales written within minor/major modes) - voice-leading, cadences, modulations, chromaticism.

- [David Huron. Voice Leading: The Science behind a Musical Art](https://amzn.to/3FIuIpe) - An accessible scientific explanation for the traditional rules of voice leading, including an account of why listeners find some musical textures more pleasing than others. Introduces the concept of auditory scene and its parsing, explains how ear anatomy leads to masking, cites many other psychoacoustic researches as well as statistical analysis of music corpora.
