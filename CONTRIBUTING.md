# Thank you for your interest in contributing to Cloud Foundry

We try to tag issues that should be reasonable for a new contributor to take on with a [good first issue](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Acloudfoundry+org%3Acommunity+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+state%3Aopen&type=Issues) label so you have somewhere to start. 

**How to contribute:**
- Fork the repo you'd like to make a contribution to
- Clone your fork to your local workstation
- Create a new branch for the issue
- Make the necessary changes on that branch
- Commit and push to that branch
- Make a Pull Request against the repo
- Sign the Contributor Licensing Agreement, if you haven’t already

All committers to a Cloud Foundry Foundation project must sign a Contributor License Agreement.
